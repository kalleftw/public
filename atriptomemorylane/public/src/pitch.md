Almost everyone loves to travel. Almost everyone who loves to travel loves to talk about their travels. Almost everyone who 
werent travelling with you, hates hearing your talk about the travel.

It's fun to talk about your travels and your adventures. It's fun to share your memories. But how? Share it on facebook? Sure, post about that weird portugiese sandwith 
you had, go ahead, tell yourself that people will care and that you one day will go back and relive these memories.

Why not post it on instagram? And let it dissappear and be forgotten in your feed.

Why not make use of it? Kill two birds with one stone.
You get to talk about your memories, post your most beloved picture of that street dog at the beach. Post that weird, but pretty good sandwitch. Tell the world about that hostel.
Maybe your friends still don't care. But who does actually care? People who are planning to visit this place.

More often, these people will do some research. They want to know about a budget, they want some reviews of this and that.
They want to hit the backpacker trifecta, cheap beer, cheap food and a cheap hostel bed.
